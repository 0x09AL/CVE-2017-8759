# CVE-2017-8759

This is an sample exploit for CVE-2017-8579 for Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Some background ##

The original CVE-2017-8579 exploit that [FireEye discovered](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/zero-day-used-to-distribute-finspy.html) was using RTF in Microsoft Word, but previous exploits for CVE-2017-0199 (script moniker version) were also found to abuse PowerPoint. I'm not sure if there were any in-the-wild exploits for the URL moniker version, however [this is also possible](https://twitter.com/buffaloverflow/status/851859854616662017).

Many people are already focusing on weaponising the RTF exploit, so I will just cover the OOXML version here.

## How to run ##

First start up a web-server locally, in the same folder as the exploit files:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

Now open the `exploit.ppsx` file. If all goes well, you should see PowerPoint fetch both `logo.png` and `w00t.hta` from your local file-server, and `calc.exe` will be run.
